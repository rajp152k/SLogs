# Summary

 - Setting up technical journal to be published on the technical blog as a sub-domain: no bells and whistles - just good old gears and nuts and bolts and screws and grease...
 - Major incentive is to keep track of all the things I learn in an organized manner
 - being public about it will allow me to use embarassment as a tool to accelerate my learning pursuits

### UPDATE:

 - This failed : gave up at Sun Sep 25 04:00:30 PM UTC 2022
 - org-roam-node-insert (org-roam-v2) links seem to have an issue
 - will need to go under the hood
 - studying about org-publish and going for a custom solution

## Expctns

 - will note down via org-roam
 - github CI/CD should handle the publishing part via hugo
 - don't want to use org-publish (heard it's slow)
 - won't be hosting pictures/videos : just text 
	- will instead point via links on other CDNs
	- mostly youtube and twitter

## S.E.U

 - might have to limit myself to a certain subset of features that org-mode provides
 	- will need to keep it simple 

## S.E.P.C

 - will be served via a sub-domain and has an independent set of ideologies
 - will have to be careful that I don't accidentally contradict myself cause will be using a different mindset

## N.C.L

 - won't be proceeding casually with this one
 - on the main blog, I don't care about mistakes : will be verbose
	- on this one, I will practice maintaining the right balance between being accurate and still being precise enough

## Cmnts

Using : https://github.com/marketplace/actions/org-publish
 on https://github.com/rajp152k/journal.git

 - do learn the basics of github actions before you proceed: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions
