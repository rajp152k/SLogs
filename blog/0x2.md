 - won't need to setup org-publish (a lot of problems with how it handles links and too many rules)

## S.E.U

 - not anticipated 

## S.E.P.C

## N.C.L

## Cmnts

 - lesson: do not re-invent the wheel
	- use the best solution available when the bottle-neck is the human mind and not tech
 	- in this case, proceeding with : https://github.com/masasam/emacs-easy-hugo

 - Lesson caveat: do reinvent the wheel if you have time and the old wheel sucks

 - Lesson caveat caveat: figuring out when to reinvent the wheel is an interesting choice to make when making long-term decisions
	- starting with a readily upgradable wheel frame is the best choice

 - static solutions are quick and easy but do hinder learning.
