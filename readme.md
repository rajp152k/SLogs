# Work Logs

### Setup info

 - Linux Raj-Y520 5.10.102.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Wed Mar 2 00:30:59 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
 - Description:	Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
 - Time of Log initialization : Tue Sep 20 05:36:28 AM UTC 2022

## Incentive

 - keep track of progress for each tool being used
 - philosophical track of topics learned
 - documenting the process so that along with the state backup, also have the path that was followed to achieve that state

## Approach

 - use markdown files named titled as hex counters and headed with `:r!date -u` (UTC)
 - in case setup is compromised, an epistemological back-track is necessary for recovery

## Format

 - Each epistemological system upgrade stores the following info:
	1. Expectations (`## Expctns`)
	2. Side Effects
		- unwanted (`## S.E.U`)
		- potential conflicts with other upgrades (`## S.E.P.C`)
	3. Novel Caveats and Limitations (`## N.C.L`)
	4. Comments (`## Cmnts`)

```
	# Time: 
	# Summary
	## Expctns
	## S.E.U
	## S.E.P.C
	## N.C.L
	## Cmnts
```

## Relevance

 - Most logs are supposed to be about language tools being installed and not the editor being used
 - for the sake of completeness:
	- for development purposes : VS code
	- for scripting purposes : minimally customized vi
	- for writing cycle : Emacs (yet to be configured)
