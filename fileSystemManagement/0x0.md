# Summary
 - Initializing rules for creating shortcuts across and within filesystems
 - fixating on using symbolic links (`man symlink`)
 - avoid hard links

## Expctns

 - Easing off navigation across frequently visited workspaces

## S.E.U

 - shouldn't affect other operations

## S.E.P.C

 - take care when globbing across file-systems with system specific scripts
 - haven't tested out how python Pathlib works but may lead to issues

## N.C.L

 - have observed git to be a little slower when working across file systems : need to test out if this is really true and correspondingly choose to clone a copy in Linux FS or continue with the existing way
 - also depends on how hugo works : probably will load the content first in a temp buffer so shouldn't be much of an issue
 - might do a meta-analysis sometime in the future
